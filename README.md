#Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
The goal of the Regression Module is to understand and implement some of the
machine learning tasks using Regression. We explored Simple Linear Regression,
Multiple Linear Regression and implemented them on chosen Data-sets from Kaggle.
We chose the Boston Housing dataset for understanding how to build the
regression model and implemented tasks such as prediction, feature reduction and
evaluation of residual plots. We implemented the learned techniques like residual
plots evaluation, model fitting, p-test on the NYC Airbnb dataset.

##The report provides a detailed analysis of the regression techniques and evaluation of the models.
